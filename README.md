# `cortex-m-quickstart`

> A template for building applications for the stm32f3-Discovery board

This project was started from the cortex-m-quickstart project from [Cortex-M team][team]. Included is a project to demonstrate **RTIC** (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency) an RTOS-like framework.

There are two ways to run under gdb:
1. In the root directory run **openocd**, In a different terminal run **cargo run**

   or
3. In the root directory run **cargo embed**. In a different terminal run **gdb-multiarch -x gdb.run target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/stm32f3disc-quickstart**

## examples RTIC

examples/rtic is a project to demonstrate **RTIC**, it includes a task to rotate the LEDs and tasks to transmit "Hello World" and echo characters. To run, change to
_examples/rtic_ and run **cargo enbed**.

## Dependencies

To build embedded programs using this template you'll need:

- Rust 1.31, 1.30-beta, nightly-2018-09-13 or a newer toolchain. e.g. `rustup
  default beta`

- The `cargo generate` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate#installation).

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:

``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi thumbv7m-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

You can find this information in the data sheet or the reference manual of your
device.

In this example we'll be using the STM32F3DISCOVERY. This board contains an
STM32F303VCT6 microcontroller. This microcontroller has:

- A Cortex-M4F core that includes a single precision FPU

- 256 KiB of Flash located at address 0x0800_0000.

- 40 KiB of RAM located at address 0x2000_0000. (There's another RAM region but
  for simplicity we'll ignore it).

1. Instantiate the template.

``` console
$ cargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-stm32f3disc-quickstart
 Project Name: app
 Creating project called `app`...
 Done! New project created /tmp/app

$ cd app
$ cargo build
```

## VS Code

This template includes launch configurations for debugging CortexM programs with Visual Studio Code located in the `.vscode/` directory.  
See [.vscode/README.md](./.vscode/README.md) for more information.  
If you're not using VS Code, you can safely delete the directory from the generated project.
